## What is Docker’s architecture?

Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker *client* talks to the Docker *daemon*, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. Both the Docker client and the daemon*can* run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate via sockets or through a RESTful API.

### The Docker daemon

As shown in the diagram above, the Docker daemon runs on a host machine. The user does not directly interact with the daemon, but instead through the Docker client.

### The Docker client

The Docker client, in the form of the `docker` binary, is the primary user interface to Docker. It accepts commands from the user and communicates back and forth with a Docker daemon.

### Inside Docker

To understand Docker’s internals, you need to know about three components:

- Docker images.
- Docker registries.
- Docker containers.

#### Docker images

A Docker image is a read-only template. For example, an image could contain an Ubuntu operating system with Apache and your web application installed. Images are used to create Docker containers. Docker provides a simple way to build new images or update existing images, or you can download Docker images that other people have already created. Docker images are the **build** component of Docker.

#### Docker registries

Docker registries hold images. These are public or private stores from which you upload or download images. The public Docker registry is provided with the [Docker Hub](http://hub.docker.com/). It serves a huge collection of existing images for your use. These can be images you create yourself or you can use images that others have previously created. Docker registries are the**distribution** component of Docker.

#### Docker containers

Docker containers are similar to a directory. A Docker container holds everything that is needed for an application to run. Each container is created from a Docker image. Docker containers can be run, started, stopped, moved, and deleted. Each container is an isolated and secure application platform. Docker containers are the **run** component of Docker.
